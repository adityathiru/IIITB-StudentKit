##Tedx
TED is a non-profit organisation devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

<a href="http://tedxiiitbangalore.com" target="_blank">TEDxIIITBangalore</a> is an independently organised event that aims to help people interact and share their knowledge and ideas and inspire others. We envisage that our event consisting of live talks, interaction and workshops, shall bring about a new ideology and perception to many. 

Our first such event was organized on March 31, 2018. 9 speakers invited who took us on a journey which demystified the wonders of their respective field of expertise.

##Spandan
Spandan is an annual sports meet organized by the students of IIIT Bangalore in the month of March every year. It is a 3-day long event fully loaded with outdoor as well as indoor games. The cheers from the fans are spread everywhere in the campus which makes the whole atmosphere jolly. It doesn't just end there. We also get a chance to meet our alumni who revisit our campus to participate in the games and share the memories the spent with their peers. 

Spandan also gives a chance to all those gamers, who spend hours together in perfecting their aim or dribbling through many players, to come up and show that they are the best. Competitive games like FIFa, NFS, and CS-GO are also organized.
