##TEDxIIITBangalore
TED is a non-profit organisation devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

<a href="http://tedxiiitbangalore.in" target="_blank">TEDxIIITBangalore</a> is an independently organised event that aims to help people interact and share their knowledge and ideas and inspire others. We envisage that our event consisting of live talks, interaction and workshops, shall bring about a new ideology and perception to many. 

These local, self-organized events are branded with TEDx, where x = an independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.


TEDxIIITBangalore strives to serve as a platform to share ideas and experiences that fundamentally change a person’s thinking. The first iteration explored the concept of demystifying the unknown, bringing out a hidden curiosity in the hearts and minds of the community. The event had now grown to be one of the biggest events in the university, stimulating ideas and spurring conversation that travels far beyond the walls that surround it.

This year on 10th September 2022 TEDxIIITBangalore was back offline with the topic ‘winds of change’. We had 8 speakers for this iteration, famous ones include Capt Tapesh Kumar(Boeing Boy), Capt Zoya Agarwal etc, Neelakantha Bhanu(fastest human calculator).

Spandan also gives a chance to all those gamers, who spend hours together in perfecting their aim or dribbling through many players, to come up and show that they are the best. Competitive games like FIFa, NFS, and CS-GO are also organized.
