<strong>(PS: The following clubs have been arranged in the alphabetical order.)</strong>

## 8Bit

<img src = "../images/clubs/8bit.png" width="250" height="170"> </img>

8Bit is the official magazine of IIIT Bangalore. It is an entirely student-run club, where they are the sole in-charge of editing the magazine, and deciding its content and structure.

The magazine provides an outlet for your creativity - all your thoughts, artistic endeavors and humor. The best part about 8Bit is that it is not limited to a specific type of content and has a place for everyone - whether you are a designer, artist, writer, editor, poet or just a social person who wants to know people by talking or interviewing them.

Here at 8Bit, the bonds are formed over lively discussion sessions and late night editing and designing marathons.
So join us for a different take in an IT college, to give you a break and let you explore your lesser known interests!

## Aikyam

<img src = "../images/clubs/aikyam.png" > </img>

Aikyam is the social wing of IIIT Bangalore that was started in 2008 by the students of IIIT Bangalore. It is an initiative taken to help the poor and the needy and understand our <strong>social responsibility</strong>.

What we do as part of Aikyam is plan ‘Aikyam Trips’ to visit orphanages occasionally and spend our day with the children there. We usually collect funds from the students in college before any trip. We buy the necessary items for the children there and also give the funds collected to the orphanage. We generally visit the ‘<a href="http://www.desiresociety.org/" target="_blank">Desire Society</a>’ - a home for HIV affected kids (aged between 3-15) , and ‘Swanthana’ - which is a home for mentally and physically challenged girls. Apart from this, we frequently collect articles like clothes, food and books from the students and donate them to the needy. For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1165116266895953&id=130926363648287" target="_blank">last year on Eid</a>, we collected these articles and donated them to the <a href="http://goonj.org/page_id=22873/" target="_blank">Goonj society</a>.

We also conduct activities in college to spread social awareness among the students. For example, we started two initiatives in 2016 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocJbYOnic60&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">The Little Things and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Aikyam-130926363648287/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1170969112977335" target="_blank">The Tiny Tales</a>. The Little Things is an initiative where the students make a short video to convey their concern to protect the environment or to support a social cause. The Tiny Tales is another such event where the students write a line or two on what they think they can do for the society. We organise events to raise funds for donation. One such event was putting up a lemonade stall or pani puri stall during the college fest. We also help in organising blood donation camps at our college.

Last year, we celebrated Diwali as a family with all members of our staff. We invited them along with their loved ones to join us and organized games and fun-filled activities for them. We provided them with clothes and money given by the students, along with sweets and crackers so that they could mingle with us on the occasion.

Why do we do all this? We believe that ‘Unity is the secret of social progress, and service to society is the means to promote it’. We spread happiness and awareness. This is the place where we can do our bit for the society and be thankful for all that we have.  

We look forward to join more hands to make our society a happier place to live in. To send in your opinions on what you can do or share any idea on social responsibility or for more such social activities, do mail us at <a href="mailto:aikyam@iiitb.org" target="_blank">aikyam@iiitb.org</a>.

## Food Committee

Food committee at IIIT Bangalore is a student body which acts as a bridge between the caterer and the students. The committee works on very sensitive and crucial issues like maintaining the sanitary conditions of kitchen, mess, and canteen. They negotiate with the caterer, prepare a menu and try to fit a balance between the taste and quality of the food served in mess. Since IIIT Bangalore has students from all across the country sometimes it becomes difficult to serve everyone as per their needs and wishes for that they have an excellent complaint portal, they not only respond but also solve the problem within 48 hrs in most cases.

This committee gives an exposure to different food cultures in our country and also builds confidence to deal with people of different backgrounds, some are literate some are not, few are so adamant about their point that you need real negotiation skills to get your point established.

If you are someone who needs to polish their managerial skills, friend, this is the right place to start with.
Join us and make a wonderful eating experience for everyone at IIIT Bangalore.

It organises programmes of classical music and dance, folk arts, crafts, yoga, classic cinema screenings, heritage walks, etc. inside school and college campuses throughout the world to make students more aware about Indian and world heritage. This initiative makes education more holistic and meaningful as it highlights all that is abstract, subtle, inspiring and mystical in the world teaching one to look within oneself.

Among the events that SPIC MACAY IIIT Bangalore chapter organised in the previous years were the Piano concert by Balázs Fülei (pianist from Hungary), Bihu dance by Shri Ranjit Gogoi and team, Chitravina concert by Sri N Ravikiran and Sitar concert by Shri Gaurav Mazumdar. We also had the rare privilege to host Dr. Kiran Seth during a session on Naad Yoga on the campus.

The events organised last year include a violin performance by the maestro TN Krishnan, Bharatanatyam performance by P Praveen Kumar and Yamini.

Yamini was a night filled with pleasant melodies and captivating dances. For twelve hours, from October 31st 6PM to November 31st 6 AM, we were enthralled by the performnaces of leading artistes - by the lilting movements of Methil Devika's Mohiniattam, Carnatic and Hindustani vocals by Bombay Jayashri and Shruti Sadolikar, and the soothing notes of Nityanand Haldipur's Hindustani Bansuri and Seshampatti Sivalingam's Nadaswaram.

SPIC MACAY runs on the energy of volunteers who come from all walks of life - students, teachers, housewives, professional and retired people, young and old. Nishkam Seva is a key aspect of the movement.
